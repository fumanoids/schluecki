This is part of the code/hardware release of team FUmanoids, version 2014. 

Our goal by releasing the source code and CAD files of components of our robot
is to provide some insight in humanoid soccer robot development, allowing other
teams to learn from our code and possibly our mistakes, but also to hopefully
encourage them to do the same and release their code as well. Though RoboCup is
a competition, it's also about research and finally to achieve our common goal -
to win against FIFA in 2050 ...



 1. TVS DIODES
--------------

 Solder the TVS Diodes to the appropriate locations (see CAD files)
 
 2. CONNECTOR
------------- 

 Solder the rectangular intermediate connector part to the board (nipple up).
 Attach the crimps to the free hanging metal pieces of the intermediate 
 connector. Best use a clamp to attach the crimps. To fix them in position use
 solder. Keep in mind that the crimps must be attached in an orientation 
 matching your desired orientation of the housing!
 Finally attach the housing to the crimps and double check for broken 
 connections.
