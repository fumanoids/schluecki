This is part of the code/hardware release of team FUmanoids, version 2014. 

Our goal by releasing the source code and CAD files of components of our robot
is to provide some insight in humanoid soccer robot development, allowing other
teams to learn from our code and possibly our mistakes, but also to hopefully
encourage them to do the same and release their code as well. Though RoboCup is
a competition, it's also about research and finally to achieve our common goal -
to win against FIFA in 2050 ...


 1. PROJECT STRUCTURE
----------------------

The FUmanoids team has developed several software applications as well as our
own robots. The latter was developed internally and equipped with both
commercially available and self-built electronics.

This release addresses only the custom-built overvoltage suppressing board 
(named Schluecki) used in the FUmanoid robots.

This project consists solely of CAD files, a partlist and an assembly guide.

 1.1 Overview of the package
-----------------------------

The project's root directory is "schluecki" (the board's name).

The directories in the root directory are:

 - hardware -- Here you can find the CAD files for the PCB.


 2. THE SCHLUECKI PROJECT
------------------------- 

Over the years we have experienced serious issues with the robot's cabling.
At some point the isolation of some wires get damaged leading to a touching
of the supply voltage wire and a data wire. The resulting overvoltage 
might damage ICs connected to the data bus. In order to prevent damage
the Schluecki board provides means to attach big TVS Diodes to the robots
acting as a crowbar circuit in case of an overvoltage event. 

The overvoltage can be detected externally and counteracting measures can
be taken into account. Have a look in the PowerBoard project for an example:

!!!!! This board does not guarantee any safety or robustness!            !!!!!
!!!!! Consider this board more like a way to reduce the risk of damages. !!!!!

 2.1 Hardware
-------------

To view the schematics and layout of this project we recommend using "CadSoft
EAGLE" which can be found at: http://www.cadsoftusa.com/

 2.2 Manufacturing
------------------

The PCB can be manufactured by most commonly known PCB services. A partlist can
be found in the folder where the schematics reside. But please double check the 
partlist since we cannot guarantee its completeness.

We chose every component on the board to be manually solderable. All you need is
a steady hand.
